## How to Contribute

As a community blog, we're hoping that the majority of our content comes from our community members. As you may have noticed, there are currently two branches for this repository. The *master* branch is intended for posts that have either been published, or are queued to be published. The *drafts* folder stores posts that are not yet finished, and are being reviewed by the blog board.

If you are unfamiliar with contributing to a github repository, I'd suggest reading [this](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) article. It's a great, simple overview of how the process works.
