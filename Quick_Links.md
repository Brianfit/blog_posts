# Quick Links - April 17, 2016 #

I will be doing a demo of the Raspberry Pi for my local library, and wanted to download every issue of The MagPi to give them an idea of what is possible. I looked on the site for a single download or even a few yearly links to no avail. The only option I could find was to download each issue individually. Figuring I could not be the first person looking for something like this, I sent a tweet to the MagPi twitter account.

>@TheMagP1 Is there a way to download all the issues at once (zip file?)  I am donating a pi to my local library & would like to include them?

and in minutes had a respose recommending the [MagPiDownloader](https://github.com/joergi77/MagPiDownloader) project from Joergi. 

>@srpsco we don't have one ourselves but you can always try this: twitter.com/joergi_77/statâ€¦ 

This was exactly what I needed and in less than 30 minutes had downloaded every issue and burned a DVD.
